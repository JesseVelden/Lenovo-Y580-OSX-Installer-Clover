# The purpose of this patch is to add code to _INI to
# disable nvidia/Radeon.  The patch is intended to be applied to
# the SSDT that contains the _INI method for the discrete card.
#
# Usually the path is \_SB.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP and the method name
# is _OFF, but some systems use different names.
#
# The path of _OFF may have to be customized to match your SSDTs
# In addition the label of EC0 may need to be changed (H_EC, EC, etc)
#
# Note: Uncomment the External line if your _OFF method is in
#   a separate SSDT.
